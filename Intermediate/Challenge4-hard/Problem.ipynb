    "in simulation, we do iterations. We take a system at a snapshot in time and call it time 0 ($t_0$). Then we increment the changes to the system every second (or whatever jump in time we choose $\\Delta t$). We take the result of the system after $\\Delta t$ has been applied, and then we plug THAT back into our formulas to find out what the system looks like after $2 \\Delta t$... and so on for as long as we like.\n",
