    "We're getting into much more realistic territory with this next challenge. Recently you're having a look at the company budget and notice it looks like Bob's been paying an awful lot to this one vendor, some \"HADOOP\" and you're suspicious that he might going over his (already generous) budget of 300000 units of money per calendar year. So you decide to do some basic calculations to look at how much he's been spending.\n",
